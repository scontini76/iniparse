Introduction to iniparse

iniparse is a INI parser for Python which is:

* Compatiable with ConfigParser: Backward compatible implementations
  of ConfigParser, RawConfigParser, and SafeConfigParser are included
  that are API-compatible with the Python standard library. They pass
  all the unit tests in Python-2.4.4.

* Preserves structure of INI files: Order of sections & options,
  indentation, comments, and blank lines are preserved as far as
  possible when data is updated.

* More convenient: Values can be accessed using dotted notation
  (cfg.user.name), or using container syntax (cfg['user']['name']).

It is very useful for config files that are updated both by users and by
programs, since it is very disorienting for a user to have her config file
completely rearranged whenever a program changes it. iniparse also allows
making the order of entries in a config file significant, which is desirable
in applications like image galleries.
